# How to use?

The folder `lectures` contains the written material, which then gets compiled into `lecture-notes.tex`, which contains the compilation of all lectures.

In `presentations` one can create and read the beamer presentation about the selected topic.

`zkdl-template.cls` is the file with the style. Do not touch it unless it is very needed.
