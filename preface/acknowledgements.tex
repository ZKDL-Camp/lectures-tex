\begin{document}

We are deeply thankful to Dmytro Zakharov, Anton Levochko, Oleg Fomenko, Roman Skovron, Nikita Masych, Denis Riabtsev, and Kyrylo Riabov for their direct participation in the creation of this book.

We additionally want to thank Oleksandr Kurbatov, Yaroslav Panasenko, Yevhen Hrubian, and Olena Voloshchuk for the valuable feedback and support.

Of course, nothing would be possible without Pavel Kravchenko, Vladymir Dubinin, and Lasha Antadze's desire to apply cryptography and zero knowledge in real applications.
