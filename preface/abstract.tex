Due to the rise of zero-knowledge technologies and their applications in
various fields such as Blockchain or anonymous identity management, it is
essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the underlying
mechanisms. However, the existing resources on the topic are either too
high-level or too low-level, making it hard for regular practicing engineers
to understand the practical implications of zero-knowledge protocols.

This book aims to bridge this gap by providing a complete, practical guide
to the state-of-the-art techniques in zero-knowledge cryptography, such as
$\Sigma$-protocols, zk-SNARKs (Groth16 in particular), PlonK and more. We
gathered all the necessary information in one place, and tried to make it
easy to follow, with numerous examples and code snippets. We attach
exercises to each chapter to help you understand the material better.
Despite the book's practical focus, we preserve the mathematical rigor where
suitable and necessary.
