\textbf{Exercise 1.} Dmytro and Denis were watching a horse race. 
    Confident in his ability to predict the outcome, Dmytro decided to commit to his prediction. 
    However, in his haste, he forgot to use a blinding factor. 
    Now, Dmytro is concerned that Denis might discover his prediction before the race ends, 
    which would defeat the purpose of his commitment.
    
    We define a dummy hash function $H(a) = (a \cdot 13 + 17) \pmod{41}$.
    Dmytro used a \textit{hash-based commitment} and $H$ as a hash function. 
    Set of race horse numbers is $(3, 5, 8, 15)$.
    Help Denis to find out the horse number Dmytro have made a commitment to, 
    if commitment equals $C = 39$.

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
    \item $3$.
    \item $5$.
    \item $8$.
    \item $15$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 2.} Denis made a setup (points $G$ and $U$) for a Pedersen commitment scheme and commited values $(m, r) = (3, 7)$ to Dmytro
by sending him $\mathcal{C} = [3]G + [7]U$. Dmytro did not verify the setup. Turns out that Denis knows that $U$ = $[6]G$. 
Denis is planning to send a different message from the one he originally committed to
to $m_2 = 15$. Which values $(m_2, r_2)$ should he send to Dmytro at the opening stage?
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
    \item $(15, 5)$
    \item $(15, 7)$
    \item $(15, 4)$
    \item $(3, 5)$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 3.} We define a dummy hash function $H(a, b) = (a \cdot 3 + b \cdot 7) \pmod{41}$. You have a Merkle tree built with depth $4$ 
using hash function $H$ with root equal $37$. Which inclusion proof is valid for element $3$?
Position defines how leaves should be hashed:

    - if $left \rightarrow h_i = Hash(h_{i-1}, branch[i])$

    - if $right \rightarrow  h_i = Hash(branch[i], h_{i-1})$

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
    \item branch: $[4, 16, 13]$, position: $[left, right, left]$
    \item branch: $[1, 40, 3]$, position: $[left, left, left]$
    \item branch: $[5, 12, 13]$, position: $[right, right, left]$
    \item branch: $[4, 17, 13]$, position: $[left, right, left]$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 4.} Given a polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 10x^2 + 31x - 30$, Oleksandr wants to prove that $p(2)=0$. 
To do that, according to the KZG commitment scheme, he constructs the quotient polynomial $q(x)$ and wants 
to show that $q(\tau) \cdot (\tau - 2) = p(\tau)$. Assuming Oleksandr has conducted these steps correctly, 
what value of $q(x)$ has Oleksandr calculated?

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
    \item $q(x) = 2x^2 + 4x - 6$
    \item $q(x) = x^3 - 10x^2 + 30x - 28$
    \item $q(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$
    \item $q(x) = x^2 + 5x + 18$
\end{enumerate}
